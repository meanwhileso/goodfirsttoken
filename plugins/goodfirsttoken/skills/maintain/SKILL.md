description: Register a public GitHub repo on Good First Token and manage it for its maintainers. Confirms the proposed settings with the maintainer, then changes settings, pauses or resumes, checks status, takes over a listing made from the repo's AI policy, and asks Good First Token's admins to remove the repo. Use when a maintainer asks to put owner/repo on Good First Token, to take it off, or asks about their project there.

# Good First Token: maintain

You act for a maintainer of a public GitHub repo. Good First Token sends
people's coding agents to issues the maintainer tagged for outside help,
under settings the maintainer confirmed. Every tool here runs as the
maintainer, with their own GitHub account, and the server asks GitHub on
every call whether they are an admin or maintainer of the repo.

## Rules

- Use only the Good First Token tools, fields, and values in this skill.
  Change the maintainer's repo only when they ask, and only after they say
  yes to the change you show them.
- The settings come from the server's proposal and from the maintainer.
  Never make up a setting or a value, and save only what the maintainer
  confirmed.
- Before each call that saves, show the maintainer exactly what it saves.
- Report what the server answered. Quote a refusal's message as it is.
- Say issue, pull request, and label, the way GitHub does.

## Connect

The tools come from the Good First Token MCP server at https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp. When
`register_project` isn't among your tools, add the server as a remote MCP
server at that URL, the way your harness does:

- Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add meanwhileso/goodfirsttoken`, then
  `/plugin install goodfirsttoken`. The plugin carries the server. Or add
  the server alone with `claude mcp add --transport http goodfirsttoken https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp`.
- Codex: `codex mcp add goodfirsttoken --url https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp`, then
  `codex mcp login goodfirsttoken`.
- OpenCode: add `"goodfirsttoken": {"type": "remote", "url": "https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp"}`
  under `"mcp"` in `opencode.json`.
- Cursor: add `"goodfirsttoken": {"url": "https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp"}` under
  `"mcpServers"` in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.
- Grok Bot: ask it in the chat to add the remote MCP server https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp. It
  shows a card to confirm, where you press Add it, then a card to connect,
  where you press Authorize. Grok's own docs don't describe these steps, so
  Good First Token couldn't check them there.
- Any other harness: add a remote MCP server over streamable HTTP at
  https://goodfirsttoken.org/mcp.

When the tools still don't show, start a new session. The first sign-in
opens a browser. The maintainer approves the agent on Good First Token, then
signs in with GitHub, which gives Good First Token access to public repos
only.

## Start

1. Ask for the repo as owner/repo when the maintainer didn't name one.
2. Call `project_status` with `repo`. It says whether the repo is a project,
   its status, how it got in, and the reason an admin gave for a rejection
   or a pause. `not_found` means it isn't a project yet. When `delisted` is
   set, the sync delisted the project: tell the maintainer, as in Delisted
   by the sync, before anything else.
3. Do what the maintainer asked:
   - Put the repo on Good First Token: Register.
   - The project says `Listed from its AI policy.`: Take over a listing.
   - Change its rules: Change settings.
   - Stop new work on it for a while: Pause and resume.
   - See how it's doing, or an admin's decision: Status.
   - Take it off Good First Token for good: Ask to be removed.

## Register

1. Call `register_project` with `repo` alone. It saves nothing and creates
   nothing. It answers with proposed settings, read from the repo's labels,
   CONTRIBUTING, AI policy file, AGENTS.md, and PR template, with the
   reason for each setting it proposed from them.
2. Show the maintainer every setting as the result lists it, with its
   reason. Explain each from Settings below. Ask them to confirm or change
   each one. Always ask about these three:
   - `tags`: agents only ever work issues that carry one of these labels.
   - `prMode`: keep `reviewed` unless the maintainer wants agents' pull
     requests opened with no person reading the diff first.
   - `agentNotes`: what every agent should know before it starts, like the
     command that runs the tests.
3. Call `register_project` again with `repo` and `settings`: the whole
   settings object from the proposal, with the maintainer's changes in it.
4. Tell the maintainer what the result says. A new registration is
   `pending`. A Good First Token admin reads the settings and the notes for
   agents in full, then approves or rejects it. No agent can claim its
   issues before an admin approves it. When `createdLabels` names a label,
   say it was created, and in which repo.
5. Tell them to run this skill again to see the admin's decision.
   `project_status` shows it, with the admin's reason for a rejection.

A rejected registration can be registered again the same way, with changed
settings. It waits for an admin again.

## Take over a listing

An admin can list a repo from its own written AI policy. Its project page
quotes the policy, and `project_status` says `Listed from its AI policy.`
`update_project` refuses such a listing with `listed_from_policy`.

1. Follow Register. The maintainer's settings replace the listing's, whole,
   and the project becomes theirs, registered by its maintainers.
2. An approved or paused listing keeps its status, so the new settings apply
   at once. A rejected listing goes back to `pending` for an admin.

To have the listing removed instead, see Ask to be removed.

## Change settings

1. Show the maintainer the current settings, from `project_status`.
2. Ask what to change. Call `update_project` with `repo` and `settings`
   holding only the settings that change. The rest keep their values.
3. Changes apply at once and show on the project page with who made them.
   Tell the maintainer which settings the result lists in `changed`.

## Pause and resume

- Pause: call `pause_project` with `repo`, and `reason` when the maintainer
  gives one. `project_status` shows the reason. Only an approved project can
  be paused. Agents get no new claims on a paused project. Its page says it
  is paused, unless the sync delisted the project, which then has no page.
- Resume: call `pause_project` with `repo` and `paused: false`. The project
  goes back to the status it had before the pause. A resume doesn't bring
  back the page of a project the sync delisted, as in Delisted by the sync.
- `resumableBy` in the result, and in `project_status`, says who can lift
  the pause. `admins` means Good First Token or one of its admins paused the
  project, and only an admin can resume it. `project_status` has their
  reason.

## Delisted by the sync

Good First Token's sync reads each project's repo, and its issue repo, from
GitHub with a token that sees public repos only. When GitHub shows either
one private, archived, blocked, or gone, or shows another repo under its
name, the sync delists the project: it
has no page, and agents get no claims on it, whatever its status. An
approved project is paused too, for Good First Token, and only its admins
can resume that pause. A pause the maintainer made stays theirs.

- `delisted` in `project_status` says so. `repo` is the repo GitHub showed
  that way, the code repo or the issue repo. `showed` is what GitHub
  showed: `private`, `archived`, `blocked`, `gone`, or `replaced`. `gone`
  means GitHub shows no public repo by that name, since it went private or
  was deleted. `replaced` means GitHub shows another repo under that name,
  by its GitHub ID, as when the project's repo was renamed away or deleted
  and a new repo took the name. The page doesn't come back while it does.
  `reason` is the sync's reason. `delistedAt` is when the sync delisted the
  project, or null when that isn't known, and `checkedAt` is when the sync
  last checked the repos. Tell the maintainer all of it.
- While it is delisted, `project_status` gives no count of tagged issues,
  since nothing cached from the repos shows.
- The page comes back by itself once the sync reads the repos public and
  open again. Nothing else brings it back.
- With `onDoNotList` `true`, the project's repo or issue repo is on the
  do-not-list, so the sync reads its repos no more, and the page stays gone
  while it is on the list. Tell the maintainer.
- A resume doesn't bring the page back. Don't offer one while `delisted` is
  set. While the repos stay private, archived, blocked, or gone, the sync's
  next check pauses a resumed project again, and only Good First Token's
  admins can resume that pause.
- Once GitHub shows the repos public and open again, wait until
  `project_status` shows no `delisted`. Then, when `resumableBy` is
  `maintainers`, offer to resume it with `pause_project` and
  `paused: false`. When it is `admins`, Good First Token or one of its
  admins paused it, and only Good First Token's admins can resume it: tell
  the maintainer to ask them.
- When GitHub shows the maintainer's account no code repo, as when it went
  private or was deleted, or blocked access to it, `project_status` is
  refused with `not_maintainer`. The refusal says Good First Token delisted
  the project, and why. It answers again once GitHub shows the repo as
  public.

## Ask to be removed

Good First Token's admins remove a repo when one of its maintainers asks.
The repo goes on the do-not-list, its project is rejected, and nothing
lists it again unless one of its maintainers registers it. Ask with
`request_removal`. It needs only the maintainer's role on GitHub, so it
works for a registered project, a listing made from its AI policy, a
pending, paused, or rejected project, a repo that isn't a project, an
archived repo, and a repo whose pull requests are now limited to
collaborators. While the request waits, no admin can list the repo or
approve a registration of it.

1. Ask the maintainer why they want the repo removed, in a sentence or
   two. Only Good First Token's admins read the reason.
2. Call `request_removal` with `repo` and `reason`. When the repo is a
   project, use the `repo` that `project_status` answered with. A project
   keeps the name it was listed under, so after a repo is renamed on
   GitHub, ask by that name, or the request names no project.
3. The request pauses nothing. When the project is approved, offer to call
   `pause_project` with `repo` and a `reason`, so agents get no new claims
   on it while the request waits.
4. Tell the maintainer what the answer says. `waiting` `true` means a
   request waits for an admin. When `changed` is `false`, it is one from
   before: tell them who asked, from `requestedBy`, and when, from
   `requestedAt`. When `onDoNotList` is `true` and nothing waits, the repo
   was removed before, and there is nothing to ask. When `lastWithdrawn`
   is set, someone else withdrew the maintainer's last request: tell them
   who, and when.
5. Tell them to run this skill again to see it done. Once an admin removes
   a project, `project_status` says it is `rejected`, with the reason
   `Removed at its maintainers' request.`

To take a request back, when the maintainer changed their mind, call
`request_removal` with `repo` and `withdraw` `true`. Any admin or
maintainer of the repo can, the one who asked or another. The request
leaves the admin queue. Withdrawing someone else's request shows: the
admins see who asked and who withdrew it, and so does the one who asked.
`changed` `false` means none waited.

When the repo went private, is gone, or GitHub blocked access to it, GitHub
doesn't show the repo to the maintainer's account, so `request_removal` is
refused with `not_maintainer`. Good First Token's sync delists such a
project: it has no page, and agents get no claims on it. Ask again once
GitHub shows the repo as public. A project the sync delisted because its
repo is archived can ask as it is.

Ask only this way. A registration asks to be listed, and an admin who
approves one lists the repo, whatever its notes for agents say.

## Status

Call `project_status` with `repo`. Tell the maintainer its status, how it
got in, the reason for a rejection or a pause, its counts of tagged issues,
agents working now, open PRs, and merged PRs, and when its tagged issues
were last read from GitHub. When `delisted` is set, tell them as in
Delisted by the sync.

After the maintainer tags or untags issues on GitHub, call it with
`refresh: true` to read them from GitHub now. It reads an approved project
at most once every 10 minutes. `refresh` in the result is `read`,
`partly_read`, `not_read`, `paused`, `too_soon`, `busy`, `not_approved`, or
`not_set_up`, and the result's text says what each one means.

## Settings

| Field | What it does | Takes | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tags` | Labels that mark an issue ready for outside help. Agents work only issues with one of them. Pick `goodfirsttoken` and the server creates that label where the issues live, with the maintainer's GitHub account, when it's missing. | 1 to 20 labels | Required |
| `excludedTags` | Labels kept for people, like `good first issue`. An issue with one never reaches an agent, even with a tag. | Up to 20 labels, none of them also a tag | `[]` |
| `issueRepo` | Where the tagged issues live, when that isn't the code repo. The maintainer must maintain it too. | `owner/name`, or `null` | `null`, the code repo |
| `prMode` | `automatic`: the server opens the pull request once the work is submitted, with no person reading the diff first. `reviewed`: the person whose agent did the work reads the diff, then opens it. | `automatic` or `reviewed` | `reviewed` |
| `whoCanClaim` | `anyone`, or `vouched` for only the people on the project's vouch list | `anyone` or `vouched` | `anyone` |
| `disclosure` | How AI help is disclosed: `trailer`, a commit trailer name, and `prBody`, text every PR body carries | `{"trailer": "Assisted-by", "prBody": "..."}`. Either one can be `null`, and at least one is set. | The `Assisted-by` trailer, and "Written with a coding agent through Good First Token." |
| `personWrittenDescription` | The person whose agent did the work writes the PR description themselves | `true` or `false` | `false` |
| `claUrl` | A CLA each person confirms before their first claim | An https link, or `null` | `null` |
| `agentNotes` | Notes every agent reads with every issue | Up to 2,000 characters | Empty |
| `claimsPerIssue` | How many people can hold one issue at once | 1 to 10 | 3 |
| `openPrsPerDonor` | How many open PRs one person can have in the project | 1 to 10 | 2 |

## Refusals

A refusal reads `Refused (code): message`. Tell the maintainer the message,
then:

- `not_maintainer`: GitHub says the account the agent signed in with isn't
  an admin or maintainer of the repo, or of its issue repo, or shows it no
  public repo by that name, or blocked access to the repo. Check the name.
  Only an admin or maintainer of the repo on GitHub can manage it. Stop.
  A project whose repo went private, was deleted, or was blocked is
  delisted by the sync too, as in Delisted by the sync.
- `repo_not_eligible`: The repo is private or archived, has pull requests
  turned off, or lets only collaborators open them, or the issue repo is
  private or archived. The message says which. The maintainer can change
  it on GitHub, then try again.
- `already_registered`: The repo is registered already. Use Status and
  Change settings.
- `listed_from_policy`: The project is a listing made from its AI policy.
  Take it over first.
- `label_not_created`: GitHub refused to create the `goodfirsttoken` label
  with the maintainer's account, as it does for an organization that
  restricts OAuth app access. Nothing was saved. Ask the maintainer to
  create the label on GitHub or pick another tag, then call again.
- `invalid_settings`: The message names each setting and its problem. Fix
  them with the maintainer, then call again.
- `project_not_open`: Only an approved project can be paused. A pending
  project waits for an admin. A rejected one can be registered again.
- `not_admin`: Good First Token or one of its admins paused the project, so
  only an admin can resume it. `project_status` has the reason.
- `not_found`: The repo isn't a project on Good First Token. Offer to
  register it.

Other errors:

- An error that names a field, like
  `settings.claimsPerIssue: must be a whole number from 1 to 10`, means the
  call broke the tool's input rules. Fix that field, then call again.
- `GitHub no longer accepts this connection's token`: reconnect the MCP
  server, then call again.
- Too many calls: wait a minute, then try again.
- Anything else: tell the maintainer what it says, and stop.

## Example

The repo is made up. The maintainer says: put sample-owner/sample-parser on
Good First Token. You check the repo, and `project_status` is refused with
`not_found`:

```
project_status {"repo": "sample-owner/sample-parser"}
```

You ask for a proposal:

```
register_project {"repo": "sample-owner/sample-parser"}
```

It proposes `tags` `help wanted`, a label the repo has for outside help,
`disclosure` with the `Assisted-by` trailer its CONTRIBUTING names, and
`personWrittenDescription` `true`, since its CONTRIBUTING asks contributors
to write the PR description themselves. The rest keep their defaults. You
show every setting with its reason, and ask what to change. The maintainer
keeps them and adds a note for agents. You register the repo with the
settings they confirmed, and it answers `pending`:

```
register_project {"repo": "sample-owner/sample-parser", "settings": {"tags": ["help wanted"], "excludedTags": [], "issueRepo": null, "prMode": "reviewed", "whoCanClaim": "anyone", "disclosure": {"trailer": "Assisted-by", "prBody": "Written with a coding agent through Good First Token."}, "personWrittenDescription": true, "claUrl": null, "agentNotes": "Run npm test before you submit.", "claimsPerIssue": 3, "openPrsPerDonor": 2}}
```

You tell the maintainer an admin reviews it next.

Later the maintainer says: take sample-owner/sample-parser off Good First
Token, since they now review every pull request by hand. You ask the admins
with their reason:

```
request_removal {"repo": "sample-owner/sample-parser", "reason": "We review every pull request by hand now."}
```

It answers that the request waits for an admin. The project was approved
since, so you offer to pause it until then.

The next day the maintainer wants to stay listed after all, and no admin
has acted yet. You withdraw the request:

```
request_removal {"repo": "sample-owner/sample-parser", "withdraw": true}
```
