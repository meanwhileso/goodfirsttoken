# Architecture

How the pieces fit today, and why the big choices were made. The plan for the
rest is in [specs/v1.md](specs/v1.md). This file changes in the same pull
request as the code it describes.

## The pieces

The repo is a pnpm workspace.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | One Cloudflare Worker for the whole service. Today it serves a placeholder home page and `/healthz`. The site, the MCP server, queue consumers, and scheduled jobs all join it here. |
| `packages/core` | Shared schemas and types: project settings, the claim state machine, the input, output, and text of every MCP tool, feed events, and refusal codes. Other packages import its TypeScript source directly, with no build step. |
| `scripts/` | The static server behind `pnpm prototype`, the skill build behind `pnpm skills:build`, and the check for advisories a pull request adds, with their tests. |
| `skill-src/` | The one source file per skill, and each plugin's version and description. Nothing installs from here. |
| `skills/` | The standalone skills that `npx skills add meanwhileso/goodfirsttoken` installs. Built from `skill-src/`. |
| `plugins/` | The Claude Code plugins, `goodfirsttoken` and `goodfirsttoken-admin`. Each plugin's `skills/` and `.claude-plugin/` folders are built from `skill-src/`. Anything else in a plugin folder is written by hand. The version rule covers the whole folder. |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Makes the repo a Claude Code plugin marketplace that lists both plugins. Built from `skill-src/`. |
| `brand/`, `prototype/`, `video/` | The brand docs, the clickable prototype the site is built from, and the launch video source. |

### apps/web

- **TanStack Start on Vite**, with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` running the
  server side inside `workerd`, the Workers runtime, in development, in
  tests, and in production.
- **`src/server.ts` is the Worker's entry point.** It hands every request to
  TanStack Start. Queue consumers, cron handlers, and Durable Object classes
  are exported from it as they arrive.
- **Routes live in `src/routes/`,** one file per route. Page routes export a
  component. HTTP endpoints like `/healthz` use `server.handlers`. The
  TanStack Router plugin writes `src/routeTree.gen.ts` on every dev run and
  build. It is committed, so a type check works without a build first.
- **Bindings and variables come from `cloudflare:workers`,** imported as
  `env`, so any module can read them.

### packages/core

- **Zod 4 for every schema,** with the TypeScript types inferred from them.
  The MCP TypeScript SDK's 1.x line takes zod 3.25 or 4, and its 2.x packages
  and Cloudflare's `agents` package need zod 4, so the MCP server can register
  these schemas as they are.
- **One module per concern.** `primitives.ts` holds the small shapes the
  rest are built from: GitHub logins, repos, issues, labels, and PRs, and our
  IDs, times, and links. `projects.ts` holds projects and their settings,
  `claims.ts` the claim state machine and the stored claim, `feed.ts` feed
  events, `refusals.ts` the refusal codes, and `validation.ts` the check that
  names the field in every problem.
- **Each MCP tool is a spec** in `src/tools/`, one file each for donors,
  maintainers, and admins: who sees it, a description for agents, input and
  output schemas, and a function that renders the output as text.
  `src/tools/index.ts` lists them all, and its `toolResult` and
  `toolRefusal` build MCP results without depending on the MCP SDK.
- **The claim state machine never reads the clock.** Its caller passes the
  time in, in the unit Durable Object alarms use, so an alarm can drive it
  and a test can set any time. The units are in
  [how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md#claims).
- **Limits live in one place.** [how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md#limits)
  lists every cap the schemas enforce, with who set it.

## Skills and plugins

`scripts/skills.mjs` builds every skill from its one source file.
`pnpm skills:build` writes the copies. `pnpm skills:check` fails when a
committed copy is not what the build writes, or when a plugin changed and
its version did not go up.

| Source | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `skill-src/<name>.md` with `plugin: goodfirsttoken` | `skills/goodfirsttoken-<name>/SKILL.md`, and `plugins/goodfirsttoken/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `skill-src/<name>.md` with `plugin: goodfirsttoken-admin` | `plugins/goodfirsttoken-admin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only |
| `skill-src/plugins.json` | Each plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |

- **A source file** starts with frontmatter that sets `description` and
  `plugin`, one top-level key per line. Other keys, like `argument-hint`,
  are copied into both copies as written. The build sets `name`, and
  `{{MCP_URL}}` in the body becomes the MCP server's URL.
- **The copies are committed,** because installers read them straight from
  GitHub. `skills/`, `.claude-plugin/`, and each plugin's `skills/` and
  `.claude-plugin/` folders hold only what the build writes, and the build
  removes anything else there.
- **The MCP server URL is set once,** as `PRODUCTION_MCP_URL` in
  `scripts/skills.mjs`. The plugin's server config is
  `${GOODFIRSTTOKEN_MCP_URL:-<that URL>}`, which Claude Code expands when it
  starts the server, so setting the variable points an installed plugin at
  another server. Building with the variable set writes copies for that
  server, such as `http://localhost:5173/mcp` for `pnpm dev`.
  `pnpm skills:check` always compares with a production build, so those
  copies fail CI.
- **Versions.** Each plugin's version is in `skill-src/plugins.json`.
  `pnpm skills:check` compares every file under `plugins/<name>/` with the
  same files at a base commit, read with `git show`. An added or removed
  file counts, and files git ignores are left out. When anything differs,
  the version must be higher than the one the base published. A lower
  version always fails. A plugin the base doesn't have can start at any
  version. The rule covers hand-written files in a plugin folder, like a
  hook, as well as built ones.
- **The base** is `origin/main`, or the ref given with `--base <ref>` or
  `SKILLS_BASE_REF`. A base that can't be found fails the check. Because the
  base is the branch the work merges into, one raise covers every later
  change in the same pull request.
- **In CI** the `test` job checks out two commits and compares with
  `HEAD^1`. For a pull request, the checkout is GitHub's merge commit, so
  `HEAD^1` is the base branch's tip. On a push to main, `HEAD^1` is the
  previous main, which holds for a squash merge and for a merge commit. A
  rebase merge of a pull request with several commits compares only its
  last commit, so it can fail on main after passing on the pull request.
- **The admin plugin** lists `goodfirsttoken` as a dependency and has no MCP
  server of its own. Installing it installs the donor plugin too, so an admin
  connects to the server once.

### What the installers read

- **`npx skills add`** reads `skills/`. We checked version 1.7.0 of the
  `skills` package. It also reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and
  scans each listed plugin's `skills/` folder, so with nothing more it would
  also offer the plugin copies, the admin skill among them. The plugin
  copies carry `metadata.internal: true`, which it skips by default. So by
  default it installs only `skills/`. Run from a local checkout, it lists
  and installs exactly the four `goodfirsttoken-*` skills. This answers
  [open question 2](specs/v1.md#open-questions).
- **Two ways around that default** install a plugin copy: naming it with
  `--skill`, like `--skill admin` or `--skill give`, and setting
  `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1`. The admin skill holds nothing secret. The
  server checks that the caller is an admin on every admin tool call, which
  #11 builds.
- **Claude Code** reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and each plugin's
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and loads each plugin's `skills/` folder.
  It ignores `metadata` in a skill. A plugin from a marketplace added as a
  local folder loads from that folder at each session start. Everyone else
  gets a cached copy, which Claude Code replaces only when the version
  changed. That happens the next time the person updates the plugin or the
  marketplace, or automatically if they turned on auto-update for it.
  Auto-update is off by default for a marketplace added from GitHub, like
  this one.

## Bindings

`apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` is the config for local development. It declares
every binding the Worker reads, under local names. Staging and production are
not in the repo. The deploy workflow (#32) will write their config from the
GitHub environment's variables, including the resource names and IDs.

| Binding | Kind | Used from |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Variable: `development`, `staging`, or `production` | Now, by `/healthz` |
| `DB` | D1 | #5 |
| `OAUTH_KV` | KV, for OAuth grants | #9 |
| `FEED_QUEUE` | Queue producer | #14 |
| `CRAWL_QUEUE` | Queue producer | #30 |

The feed's dead-letter queue arrives with the feed consumer in #14, and the
static host's R2 bucket with #33. Durable Objects, cron triggers, and rate
limiters arrive with the issues that use them.

## Configuration and secrets

The repo is public, so `wrangler.jsonc` holds bindings and settings only. The
names of deployed resources, account IDs, resource IDs, custom domains, and
secrets never go in a file. The deploy workflow (#32) will write them into
the final config from the GitHub environment's variables. Where an ID is left
out, Wrangler provisions the resource on the first deploy.

Local development needs none of it. `pnpm dev` runs the Worker in Miniflare,
which simulates every binding and keeps D1 and KV data on disk under
`apps/web/.wrangler/`. The variables the app reads, with safe local defaults,
are listed in `apps/web/.dev.vars.example`.

## Types

TypeScript is strict in every package, with shared settings in
`tsconfig.base.json`.

`wrangler types` writes `apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts`: the `Env` type
for the bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`, and the Workers runtime types for its
compatibility date. Variables are typed as strings, because the deployed
values come from outside the file. `pnpm install` runs it. The file is not
committed, because it is 600 KB and its header carries a 32-character hash
that the leak scan cannot tell from a Cloudflare ID. `pnpm typecheck` fails
when the file no longer matches `wrangler.jsonc`, and `pnpm install` brings
it up to date.

`apps/web/tsconfig.json` covers the Worker and its tests.
`apps/web/tsconfig.node.json` covers the config files and the Playwright
tests, which run in Node.

## Tests

The rules for tests are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#tests).

- **Unit and integration tests** run with Vitest inside `workerd`, through
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, with the bindings from `wrangler.jsonc`.
  They call the whole Worker through `exports.default.fetch` from
  `cloudflare:workers`, so a test sees the same routing and headers a
  browser does. They live in `apps/web/test/`.
- **End-to-end tests** run with Playwright against the production build,
  served by `vite preview` inside `workerd`. They live in `apps/web/e2e/`.
- **The core package's tests** run with plain Vitest in Node, since the
  package is pure. They live in `packages/core/test/`.
- **The tests for `scripts/`**, the static server and the skill build, use
  Node's own test runner.

`pnpm test` runs all of them but Playwright. `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and on pushes to
`main`, on GitHub-hosted runners, with a read-only token. It uses no secrets,
so a pull request from a fork runs the same checks as one from a branch.
Every action is pinned to a commit SHA.

| Job | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `test` | `pnpm test`, then `pnpm skills:check` with `HEAD^1` as the base |
| `lint` | `pnpm lint`: ESLint with type-aware rules from typescript-eslint |
| `typecheck` | `pnpm typecheck` |
| `e2e` | `pnpm test:e2e` in Chromium, keeping the report and traces when it fails |
| `leaks` | gitleaks over the full history, with the rules in `.gitleaks.toml` |

Branch protection requires `test` and `leaks` by name.

### Security scans

`.github/workflows/security.yml` runs on every pull request under the same
rules as CI. Each tool a job downloads itself is checked against a published
checksum, and the Semgrep image is pinned by digest. The CodeQL action brings
the CodeQL version its commit names. Semgrep's rules come from the Semgrep
Registry at scan time, since their license doesn't allow copying them here. A
job names a finding only when it sits in code the pull request adds or edits,
which the diff already shows. Findings elsewhere on `main` stay in code
scanning.

| Job | What it scans | What it blocks | Where findings go |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semgrep` | Code and workflows, with Semgrep's TypeScript, React, and GitHub Actions rules | A high-severity finding the pull request adds | Code scanning |
| `codeql` | JavaScript and TypeScript, with CodeQL's default queries | A high or critical alert on a line the pull request changes, through the `Code scanning results / CodeQL` check | Code scanning |
| `zizmor` | Every workflow and action | A high-severity finding in any of them | Code scanning |
| `osv-scanner` | `pnpm-lock.yaml` before and after the pull request, against osv.dev | A package version with a high or critical advisory, or a known-malicious package, that the pull request adds | The job log, naming only what the pull request adds |
| `dependency-review` | The dependency graph before and after the pull request, against the GitHub Advisory Database | A package version with a high or critical advisory that the pull request adds | The job log and summary, naming only what the pull request adds |

Code scanning accepts uploads from a pull request's read-only token, from a
fork too. On the pull request it shows a finding as an annotation only when
the finding sits on a line the pull request changes. The rest stays in the
Security and quality tab, which only people with write access can see. The
`semgrep` and `zizmor` jobs fail with a short message that points there.
Every job but `zizmor` fails only on what the pull request adds or edits.
zizmor's check runs offline with a pinned version, so a high finding in any
workflow can only come from a workflow change, and it blocks every pull
request until it is fixed.

`.github/workflows/security-weekly.yml` runs Semgrep, CodeQL, zizmor, and
OSV-Scanner on `main` every Monday at 05:23 UTC, and by hand from the Actions
tab. It catches new advisories and new rules for code that hasn't changed. It
uploads every finding to code scanning, and fails only when a scan or an
upload breaks. It is the only workflow that can write, and it writes only
`security-events`, which the upload needs. Code scanning matches each finding
to the alert it already has, so a second run files nothing new. Code scanning
doesn't notify anyone when it files an alert, so a maintainer checks the
Security and quality tab after the Monday run. [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)
says what happens next.

Two habits keep findings out of public logs. SARIF files are never kept as
workflow artifacts, which anyone signed in can download. And a CodeQL job is
never re-run with debug logging, because CodeQL then keeps its results as an
artifact.

The scans rely on these repository settings:

- Private vulnerability reporting is on.
- CodeQL default setup is off, since code scanning refuses CodeQL results
  from a workflow while it is on.
- Dependabot alerts are off, since OSV-Scanner files the same advisories.
- Branch protection requires the five jobs above, and a ruleset requires code
  scanning results from CodeQL, Semgrep OSS, and zizmor at high severity.

## Choices

- **One Worker for everything.** The site, the MCP server, and the background
  jobs share one deploy, one set of bindings, and one runtime to test in.
- **Tests run in `workerd`,** the Workers runtime, so a test sees the same
  `fetch`, streams, and crypto the Worker does. The unit tests use the
  `workerd` that `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` pins, which can be older
  than the one dev and preview use. That caps the compatibility date in
  `wrangler.jsonc` at the newest date the pinned one supports.
- **TypeScript 6.** typescript-eslint does not yet support TypeScript 7, and
  type-aware lint rules like `no-floating-promises` catch real bugs in
  Workers code.
- **Vitest 4.1.** It is the newest line `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
  supports. `packages/core` uses the same version.
- **One text block per tool result.** The MCP spec suggests that a tool
  returning structured content also send it as serialized JSON in a text
  block. Ours holds a plain rendering of the result, because terminal
  harnesses show that text to the agent and the donor. The data is already in
  `structuredContent`.
- **The production MCP URL is in the repo.** Installers read the plugin and
  the skills from GitHub, with no environment to supply an address, so the
  URL is part of what we publish. No deploy reads it. Deploy config still
  never names a domain.
- **The skill drift check runs in the `test` job,** which branch protection
  requires, so a hand edit to a generated file blocks the merge.
- **Plugin versions are compared with the base branch.** Nothing a pull
  request edits can get around the rule, and one raise covers the whole
  pull request.
- **Code scanning holds security findings.** Alerts on `main` are visible
  only to people with write access, and code scanning matches repeat
  findings by fingerprint. Dependabot alerts are private too, but a workflow
  can't file them, and they would repeat every OSV-Scanner alert. Issues and
  pull request comments are public.
- **Semgrep and CodeQL both.** CodeQL follows data across functions and
  files, such as a token that reaches a log. Semgrep's free rules match
  patterns within a file, cover GitHub Actions, and run in seconds.
- **No Dependabot security updates or OpenSSF Scorecard.** Security updates
  need Dependabot alerts, which would file every advisory a second time, and
  they open a pull request for each one. Scorecard's workflow checks repeat
  zizmor's, and its other checks grade practices this repo doesn't have yet,
  such as fuzzing and signed releases, so it would file alerts nobody fixes.
