# Architecture

How the pieces fit today, and why the big choices were made. The plan for the
rest is in [specs/v1.md](specs/v1.md). This file changes in the same pull
request as the code it describes.

## The pieces

The repo is a pnpm workspace.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | One Cloudflare Worker for the whole service. Today it serves a placeholder home page, the design system at `/design`, and `/healthz`. The site, the MCP server, queue consumers, and scheduled jobs all join it here. |
| `packages/core` | Shared schemas and types. Today it holds only the product name. Other packages import its TypeScript source directly, with no build step. |
| `scripts/` | The static server behind `pnpm prototype`, with its tests. |
| `brand/`, `prototype/`, `video/` | The brand docs, the clickable prototype the site is built from, and the launch video source. |

### apps/web

- **TanStack Start on Vite**, with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` running the
  server side inside `workerd`, the Workers runtime, in development, in
  tests, and in production.
- **`src/server.ts` is the Worker's entry point.** It hands every request to
  TanStack Start. Queue consumers, cron handlers, and Durable Object classes
  are exported from it as they arrive.
- **Routes live in `src/routes/`,** one file per route. Page routes export a
  component. HTTP endpoints like `/healthz` use `server.handlers`. The
  TanStack Router plugin writes `src/routeTree.gen.ts` on every dev run and
  build. It is committed, so a type check works without a build first.
- **Bindings and variables come from `cloudflare:workers`,** imported as
  `env`, so any module can read them.

### The design system

- **Components are React components in `src/components/`,** one file per
  component, which any route imports. `/design` (`src/routes/design.tsx`)
  shows every one of them with sample data. It replaced the prototype's
  design-system page.
- **Styles are plain CSS in `src/styles/`.** `tokens.css` holds the tokens
  from the YAML in `brand/design.md` as CSS variables. `app.css` bundles it
  with the fonts, the base styles, and every component's styles, and the
  root route links it on every page. CSS for one page, like
  `design-page.css`, is linked from that route's `head`. Class names follow
  the prototype's.
- **The fonts are self-hosted.** `src/fonts/` holds the Geist and Geist Mono
  variable fonts from the `geist` npm package, version 1.7.2, under the SIL
  Open Font License in `src/fonts/OFL.txt`. Vite gives each file a content
  hash, the Worker's static assets serve it, and the root route preloads
  both. #33 moves them to the static host.
- **The nav folds on its own width,** with a container query, so the same
  component works full width at the top of a page and inside a narrower
  frame.

## Bindings

`apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` is the config for local development. It declares
every binding the Worker reads, under local names. Staging and production are
not in the repo. The deploy workflow (#32) will write their config from the
GitHub environment's variables, including the resource names and IDs.

| Binding | Kind | Used from |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Variable: `development`, `staging`, or `production` | Now, by `/healthz` |
| `DB` | D1 | #5 |
| `OAUTH_KV` | KV, for OAuth grants | #9 |
| `FEED_QUEUE` | Queue producer | #14 |
| `CRAWL_QUEUE` | Queue producer | #30 |

The feed's dead-letter queue arrives with the feed consumer in #14, and the
static host's R2 bucket with #33. Durable Objects, cron triggers, and rate
limiters arrive with the issues that use them.

## Configuration and secrets

The repo is public, so `wrangler.jsonc` holds bindings and settings only. The
names of deployed resources, account IDs, resource IDs, custom domains, and
secrets never go in a file. The deploy workflow (#32) will write them into
the final config from the GitHub environment's variables. Where an ID is left
out, Wrangler provisions the resource on the first deploy.

Local development needs none of it. `pnpm dev` runs the Worker in Miniflare,
which simulates every binding and keeps D1 and KV data on disk under
`apps/web/.wrangler/`. The variables the app reads, with safe local defaults,
are listed in `apps/web/.dev.vars.example`.

## Types

TypeScript is strict in every package, with shared settings in
`tsconfig.base.json`.

`wrangler types` writes `apps/web/worker-configuration.d.ts`: the `Env` type
for the bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`, and the Workers runtime types for its
compatibility date. Variables are typed as strings, because the deployed
values come from outside the file. `pnpm install` runs it. The file is not
committed, because it is 600 KB and its header carries a 32-character hash
that the leak scan cannot tell from a Cloudflare ID. `pnpm typecheck` fails
when the file no longer matches `wrangler.jsonc`, and `pnpm install` brings
it up to date.

`apps/web/tsconfig.json` covers the Worker and its tests.
`apps/web/tsconfig.node.json` covers the config files and the Playwright
tests, which run in Node.

## Tests

The rules for tests are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#tests).

- **Unit and integration tests** run with Vitest inside `workerd`, through
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, with the bindings from `wrangler.jsonc`.
  They call the whole Worker through `exports.default.fetch` from
  `cloudflare:workers`, so a test sees the same routing and headers a
  browser does. They live in `apps/web/test/`.
- **End-to-end tests** run with Playwright against the production build,
  served by `vite preview` inside `workerd`. They live in `apps/web/e2e/`.
- **Screenshot tests** compare `/design` at 360, 390, 768, 1024, and 1280px
  with the baselines in `apps/web/e2e/design.spec.ts-snapshots/`, with the
  clock paused so the live wall holds still. Up to 2% of pixels may differ,
  because Chromium builds draw text a little differently. A change in page
  height always fails. After a deliberate visual change, run
  `pnpm --filter @goodfirsttoken/web exec playwright test --update-snapshots=all`
  and commit the new images.
- **The static server's tests** in `scripts/` use Node's own test runner.

`pnpm test` runs the first and last. `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and on pushes to
`main`, on GitHub-hosted runners, with a read-only token. It uses no secrets,
so a pull request from a fork runs the same checks as one from a branch.
Every action is pinned to a commit SHA.

| Job | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `test` | `pnpm test` |
| `lint` | `pnpm lint`: ESLint with type-aware rules from typescript-eslint |
| `typecheck` | `pnpm typecheck` |
| `e2e` | `pnpm test:e2e` in Chromium, keeping the report and traces when it fails |
| `leaks` | gitleaks over the full history, with the rules in `.gitleaks.toml` |

Branch protection requires `test` and `leaks` by name.

## Choices

- **One Worker for everything.** The site, the MCP server, and the background
  jobs share one deploy, one set of bindings, and one runtime to test in.
- **Tests run in `workerd`,** the Workers runtime, so a test sees the same
  `fetch`, streams, and crypto the Worker does. The unit tests use the
  `workerd` that `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` pins, which can be older
  than the one dev and preview use. That caps the compatibility date in
  `wrangler.jsonc` at the newest date the pinned one supports.
- **TypeScript 6.** typescript-eslint does not yet support TypeScript 7, and
  type-aware lint rules like `no-floating-promises` catch real bugs in
  Workers code.
- **Vitest 4.1.** It is the newest line `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
  supports.
